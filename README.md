## Overview

**Rogue Radar** is a handheld ESP32-S3 firmware built for the **LilyGO T-Embed** that combines multiple wireless and utility tools into one rotary-driven interface.

The firmware uses **LVGL** for the UI, **TFT_eSPI** for the 320x170 ST7789 display, **BLE + WiFi** features from the ESP32 core, **TinyGPS++** for GPS data, **APA102 LEDs** for visual status feedback, and optional I2S speaker output for alerts and menu feedback.

It is designed around fast menu navigation, onboard scanning tools, live signal data, GPS stats, SD-based update support, and a clean embedded dashboard feel.

## UI / Controls

Rogue Radar is built around a **rotary encoder driven interface** using LVGL input groups.

### Controls
- **Rotate encoder** to move through menus and lists
- **Press encoder** to select items
- **T-Embed CC1101 top button:** press and release to go Back one level, or cancel text entry. It does nothing on the main menu. During a blocking scan, Back is deferred until the scan returns; holding the button does not repeat.
- **Power Off** is available through Misc Tools on supported board profiles.

The APA102 LEDs are also used for menu color feedback and scan animations. Optional speaker feedback can provide detection chirps and quiet menu tick/click sounds.

## Roadmap Ideas

Planned next, in this order (not yet implemented):

1. **Saved Devices — Find and Track Known Devices:** save a known Wi-Fi or BLE
   device on the SD card with a custom name, then select it later to locate it through
   Track Signal's live chart, LED ring meter, and optional audio guidance.
2. **Learn a Known Device:** select a nearby candidate and save its advertised
   details; associate additional observed addresses with explicit confirmation.
   Similar advertisements suggest possible matches, not confirmed identities.
3. **Nearby Signals:** discover Wi-Fi access points and BLE advertisers in a
   stable, signal-ranked list, then track a result or save it for future locating.

See the [feature plan](FEATURE_PLAN.md) for descriptions, storage, identity
limitations, and documentation wording.

Other ideas:

- Add logging/export for scan results
- Add richer BLE classification and filtering
- Expand GPS tool set
- Add more SD card utilities
- Add icon assets and polish for each tool page
